                        	<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I was born in Athens, Greece.
I received the ECE Dipl. from the
<a href="http://www.ntua.gr">National Tech. Univ. of Athens</a> in 1990.
I then spend 12 years in the east coast studying and doing research. 
I received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees 
from <a href="http://www.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>,
in 1991 and 1995, respectively.
My thesis work focused on analyzing and modeling non-linear 
interaction between source and vocal tract during speech production. The work relied
heavily on the AM-FM speech model proposed by my advisor
Petros Maragos with colleagues Jim Kaiser and 
Tom Quatieri. 
</p>

I then went on to work for 
<a href="http://www.bell-labs.com">Bell Labs</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.research.att.com">AT&T Shannon Labs</a>.
My research work there focused on robust speech recognition
in collaboration with my mentor Rick Rose, on children
speech analysis, recognition and interaction with my long-time
collaborator and friend Shri Narayanan, and on spoken
dialogue interaction with the DARPA Communicator team at Bell Labs
most notably Eric Fosler-Lussier, Jeff Kuo and Egbert Ammicht. 
While at Bell Labs I embarked on a part-time M.B.A. at
<a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu">
Stern School of Business</a>, <a href="http://www.nyu.edu">NYU</a>. 
</p>

<p>
among world-class colleagues including Vas Digalakis. My work there focused on 
robust speech recognition, multimedia processing, child-computer interaction, spoken dialogue systems 
and more recently lexical semantics.
In 2013, I went back to my old stomping grounds at NTUA, now as an academic, working with
work-class colleagues and students on
child-robot interaction, emotion recognition, 
language development and deep learning.
</p>

<p>
In 2016, together with Shri Narayanan and Prem Natarajan, we founded 
<a href="http://www.behavioralsignals.com">Behavioral Signals</a> an
emotion AI deep tech startup, where I served both as a CEO and CTO. 
In 2021, I joined <a href="https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/conversational-ai-natural-language-processing"> Alexa as an Amazon </a> scholar working on 
natural multiparty dialogue joining forces with excellent colleagues and good friends.

<p>
My current research interests include
speech processing, analysis, synthesis and recognition,

natural language understanding, large language models, general artificial intelligence,
behavioral informatics, affective analysis, modeling and recognition,
machine learning and representation learning, 
cognitive semantics,

I am especially interested on how cognitive semantic representations can
motivate us to create computational models that are robust, accurate and 
rapid learners of multimodal information with application to deep learning.
